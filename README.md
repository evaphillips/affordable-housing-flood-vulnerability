# Affordable Housing in NYC Floodplains

As climate change drives sea levels higher, planners and policymakers must proactively prepare to protect vulnerable communities from flooding. With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, subsidized properties in floodplains face heightened risks for both resident wellbeing and the building preservation. Buildings that don't meet flood-resistant standards are susceptible to damage, potentially leading to loss of essential subsidized housing stock. Retrofitting buildings to withstand floods can incur substantial costs for property owners. Further, more subsidized housing continues to be built in areas such as Coney Island, despite increased flood risk.

Inspired by a national [NYU Furman Center analysis](https://furmancenter.org/research/publication/housing-in-the-us-floodplains) of housing in flooplains, I decided to map out the city's subsidized stock in relation to the floodplain and flood vulnerability index. 

### Data sources:
- Floodplains & vulnerability index come form the [New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC)](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/6a3da7b920f248af961554bdf01d668b/page/Climate-Change/?views=Viewing-Pop-Up-Content)
- Data on subsidized housing comes from the [National Housing Preservation Database](https://nhpd.preservationdatabase.org/Account)

### Interactivity

The map prompts users to toggle layers on and off to see the changing floodplain and vulnerability index. It also allows users to click on a property to see more details, including its subsidy source, name, address, and number of units.
